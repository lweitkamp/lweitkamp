### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a deep learning engineer for Thirona, a medical imaging startup. I'm also:

- [Working on](https://github.com/lweitkamp/numpitron) a distributed transformer learning system in NumPy using MPI - Data and Tensor parallel is working.
- Currently learning the ~~rust ðŸ¦€~~ Zig language.
